## Introduction

Time series forecasting is essential in various domains, including finance, economics, and supply chain management. Traditional methods like ARIMA are commonly used, but machine learning models, such as XGBoost, have gained popularity due to their ability to capture complex patterns in data. This project showcases how to leverage XGBoost for time series analysis.

## Dataset

The notebook utilizes a time series dataset, which is placed in the `data/` directory. Ensure that the dataset is properly formatted and preprocessed for analysis. 

## Installation

To run the notebook, ensure you have the following dependencies installed:

- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook
- XGBoost
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib

You can install the required packages using `pip`:

```bash
pip install jupyter xgboost pandas numpy scikit-learn matplotlib
```

## Usage

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/erfan-seifi/TimeSeriesAnalysis_GXBoost.git
```
cd TimeSeriesAnalysis_GXBoost
3. Place your dataset in the data/ directory.
4. Launch Jupyter Notebook:
```bash
jupyter notebook
```
5. Open the XGBoost_for_TimeSeriesDataset.ipynb notebook.
6. Run the cells sequentially to execute the analysis.

## Notebook Overview

The notebook covers the following steps:

1. Data Loading: Importing the time series dataset.
2. Data Preprocessing: Handling missing values, feature engineering, and scaling.
3. Feature Engineering: Creating lag features and rolling statistics to capture temporal dependencies.
4. Model Training: Training the XGBoost model on the prepared dataset.
5. Model Evaluation: Assessing the model's performance using appropriate metrics.
6. Forecasting: Making future predictions and visualizing the results.

## Results

The notebook provides visualizations and evaluation metrics to assess the performance of the XGBoost model on the time series forecasting task. Detailed results and interpretations are included within the notebook.
